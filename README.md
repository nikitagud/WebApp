# WebApp
My first web-application
My web application utilizes the request method to retrieve book information from an API and store it in a database. Additionally, I have implemented a separate database to store usernames and hashed passwords.

The login and signup pages make use of both the POST and GET methods. When users attempt to log in, the application verifies their credentials and provides informative flash messages in case of errors. Similarly, during the signup process, the application checks if the chosen username already exists in the user credentials database and displays appropriate flash messages to guide the user.

This approach ensures secure storage of user credentials and provides a smooth user experience by handling login and signup actions effectively.
